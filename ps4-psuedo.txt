Your algorithms should be plain English explanations for the steps your program will take to solve these problems.

Write out your algorithm for Problem 2 here:
Rando thoughts - step 1 - take in text.
Step 2. Try different decode shifts
Step 3. Check which shift produces maximum number of words
Step 4. count number of words and store
step 5. if current count > maximum, which starts at 0, store this shift.
step 6. return shift

Write out your algorithm for Problem 4 here:
Step 1. Take in text
Step 2. Iterate over text and decode until you find the first correct word
Step 3. Take the rest of the text and use recursion to recall text from that point onwards and apply decoder
